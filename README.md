# SE Central

KMITL Web Programming Project

## Introduction

SE Central is a web application to provide students and teachers alike with a variety of features through a pleasing UX/UI design.
Prospective scholars will be able to engage in discussions and bond with current SE students in a forum. 
They will be able to create posts that others will be able to comment on including features to edit and delete. 
The forum also includes a search function allowing users to find posts relating to their interests.
We also provide a series of Python programming challenges to prepare them for their development journey. 
The challenges will be in varying levels of difficulty. 
Users who register will be able to earn points for completing challenges and compete with their peers to earn the most points.
